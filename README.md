# ArtificallyIntellegentTicTacToe


For my Artifical Intelegence Programming Class, I designed a bot that plays Tic Tac Toe and never loses (resulting in either a tie or a win). I used Min, Max - Alpha Beta Prununing to create a tree of all possible scenarios depending on the current board and then from there make the optimal move. 

The GameApp.py just initalizes and prints the original state of the game. The code for the intellgent computer player is in mytictactoe.py.
